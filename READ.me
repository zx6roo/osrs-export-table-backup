# Export OSRS Table Backup (multiple pages)

This bookmarklet exports all saved OSRS Wiki table highlight backup data (`osrsTableBackup`) from your browser's localStorage into a formatted Excel (.xlsx) file. The file includes headers and the current date in its filename.

## How to Use

1. Copy the **minified** bookmarklet code (`osrs-export-table-backup.min.js`).
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser.
3. Paste the minified code into the bookmarkâ€™s URL/location field.
4. After saving some pages using the backup bookmarklet, visit any page.
5. Click the bookmark to export all saved data as an Excel file.
6. If a backup exists, an `.xlsx` file will be downloaded containing all saved entries.

## Notes

- Requires internet access to load the SheetJS (XLSX) library.
- Relies on `osrsTableBackup` data saved in your browser's localStorage.
- Loads the XLSX library dynamically if not already loaded.
- Saves file as `OSRC wiki tables backup YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`.
- The exported spreadsheet includes: page ID, page name, URL, table number, and highlight string.
- If no backup data is found in localStorage, an alert will be shown.
- Works entirely client-side; no data leaves your browser.
